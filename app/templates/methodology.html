                Before designing our calculator, it is important to understand the different methods used to compare modes of transport 
                and measure their emissions. The most common approach is to calculate the amount of carbon dioxide equivalent (\(CO_2e\)) 
                emissions for transporting a passenger by a defined mode of transport over one kilometer (passenger kilometer). This 
                metric allows for emissions data to be standardized per individual passenger, regardless of the transportation mode. <br> <br>

                The \(CO_2e\) metric represents the amount of GHG emissions that have been converted into an equivalent
                amount of \(CO_2\). The global warming potential (GWP) parameter is used to convert these
                emissions, such as \(N_{2}O\), \(CH_{4}\) and other GHG emissions, into a common unit of measurement.
                By converting GHG emissions into \(CO_2\) equivalents, it becomes easier to compare the environmental impact 
                of different modes of transportation. Thus, \(CO_2e\) considers factors such as the type and amount of fuel used, 
                making it a comprehensive and accurate measurement for assessing the environmental impact. <br> <br>

                To show how \(CO_2e\) works, we will provide a simple example with methane (\(CH_{4}\)). Methane has a GWP of approximately 27,
                meaning that the emission of 1 kg of \(CH_{4}\) equals the emission of 27 kg of \(CO_2\). This implies that the
                emission of 1 kg of \(CH_{4}\) and 27 kg of \(CO_2\) has the same adverse environmental impact. We can calculate the \(CO_2e\)
                using the following equation, where “a” is number of kg emitted and “c” is the GWP:

              If we emit 1 kg of \(CH_{4}\), which has a GWP of 27 kg as previously stated, the equation will look as follows:

              When combusting fossil fuels, several GHGs are emitted. To calculate the \(CO_2e\) emission from the combustion, we must
              convert the emissions from each GHG to \(CO_2e\). We can do this by multiplying the number of kilograms emitted of the
              given GHG (a), with the GWP of the GHG (c). Then we have to sum the \(CO_2e\) of all the GHGs. We can express this as
              in the equation below, where “i” is a given GHG and “n” is the number of GHGs.

              If we want to express the \(CO_2e\) per passenger kilometer traveled, we can modify the equation, where “d”
              is the number of passenger miles traveled.

              To demonstrate the use of equation 4, we will provide a simple example as follows. Alice travels 100 passenger 
              kilometers, which emits 2 kg \(CH_{4}\) (i=1), 0,2 kg \(N_{2}O\) (i=2) and 10 kg \(CO_2\) (i=3). \(N_{2}O's\) GWP is
              273 and \(CO_{2}\ 's\) GWP is 1. Given this information, we can calculate Alice's \(CO_{2}e\) emission
              per passenger kilometer traveled as follows:

                \[{CO_2e \over d} = {2\ kg * 27 + 0,2\ kg * 273 + 10\ kg * 1 \over 100\ km}\] <br><br>
                \[= {CO_2e \over d} = 1,186 {kg \over km}\]
